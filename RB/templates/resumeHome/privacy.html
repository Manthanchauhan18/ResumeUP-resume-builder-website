(The Site and Applications are sometimes collectively referred to as “Online Services”) ResumeBuild takes your privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to keep your personal and financial information secure.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Privacy Policy covers ResumeBuild’s treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use the Online Services. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Service. By using ResumeBuild Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Service at support@ResumeBuild.com.</span></p>

<p id="InformationCollectedText"><b>1. Information Collected</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic Data. ResumeBuild may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data (collectively “Visitor Data”). The ResumeBuild internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively “Traffic Data”). We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies. ResumeBuild and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow ResumeBuild to store a small piece of data on a visitor’s computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of Applications. ResumeBuild does not capture Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited. To manage Flash cookies, please click here: </span><a style="display: block; overflow: hidden;" href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Beacons. We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd Party Tracking. The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Information. ResumeBuild requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively “Personally Identifiable Information”) to access and use ResumeBuild products and services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a ResumeBuild employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by ResumeBuild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally Identifiable Information includes but is not limited to: (i) “Contact Data” (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) “Financial Data” (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code or bank account information); (iii) “Demographic Data” (such as your zip code and sex); and (iv) other “Legal Data” (such as your social security number, mortgage information, automobile information, marital information, trade secrets, inventions, and idea submissions and other sensitive information necessary to generate legal documents).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect the information of 3rd party individuals as necessary, such as to ask our customers to indicate beneficiaries of a will, record shareholders of a company, or register authorized contacts to access their ResumeBuild account. ResumeBuild uses this information for the sole purpose of administering its services for our customers, and does not use such information for any other reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at support@ResumeBuild.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testimonials and Reviews. We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers received through email surveys. We ask for your specific consent as part of the survey. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at support@ResumeBuild.com. We also display customer reviews. If you provide a review that we display and wish to update or delete it, you can also contact us at support@ResumeBuild.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls/Electronic Communications. In the regular course of our business, ResumeBuild may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and ResumeBuild employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive email from ResumeBuild, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list by using the “Unsubscribe” link on any of the emails we send.</span></p>
<p id="UseInformationText"><b>2. Use of Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use information we collect from the Online Services to communicate with you, process your orders, facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing partners, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting Out. We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting customer service at support@ResumeBuild.com. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by using the “Unsubscribe” link and following the unsubscribe instructions in any electronic communication or by emailing us at support@ResumeBuild.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose not to provide ResumeBuild with Personally Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, ResumeBuild cannot process orders without Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys, Sweepstakes, and Contests. We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site, to measure customer satisfaction. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes name, email address, and mailing address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site, and/or to send participants an email newsletter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share customer information with third parties only as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Order Processing. ResumeBuild, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or ResumeBuild subsidiary, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through merchant account services, and to generate the products and services you order. Your Contact Data may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate through Online Services, respond to inquiries made through Online Services, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information about ResumeBuild and its products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Party Marketing. Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third party offer or purchase a package that includes a third party offer, we may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Required by Law. We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitor Demographics. Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information about our users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Providers. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer or email service provider), help us market our products and services, or for training purposes. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner and Affiliate Tracking. Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how the Provider responds to ‘Do not track’ browser settings. The Provider does not currently take action to respond to Do not track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been adopted. We continue to review new technology and may adopt a standard once one is universally accepted.</span></p>
<p id="NoticeEuropeanUnionResidentsText"><b>10. Notice to residents of the European Union</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Provider complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’). As such, the Provider affords to all European data subjects their respective data privacy rights to the extent that they are applicable, including: (i) the right to rectify inaccurate data; (ii) the right to erasure (deletion of your Personal Information); (iii) the right to restrict processing of your Personal Information; (iv) the right of data portability; and (v) the right to object. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at support@ResumeBuild.com or contact-us. In order to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorised access, we can ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your Personal Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In certain situations, and subject to applicable law, the Provider will not be able or obliged to comply with part or all of your individual requests. Please note that we have the right to refuse and/or charge a monetary fee for requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example due to their repetitive character. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU supervisory authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing your information to us is optional, but it can affect our ability to offer you the Service. For example, if you do not provide your complete Personal Information, we will not always be able to respond to your request in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p id="PrivacyThirdParties"><b>11. Third Parties</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Site can contain links to other third-party websites, and the Provider can provide products and services that share information with third-party sites for your job search. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites, so it is important to familiarise yourself with their privacy policies before providing your Personal Information.</span></p>
<p id="PrivacyInfoSecurityText"><b>12. Information security</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain technical, physical and administrative security measures designed to protect the security of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorised or accidental access, disclosure, copying, use or alteration. Some of the safeguards that we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, information access authorisation controls and other measures in accordance with industry standards. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is totally secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</span></p>
<p id="ChildrensPrivacyText"><b>13. Children’s Privacy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Site is a general-audience site and it is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information via our websites, applications, services or tools from users in this age group. If you are a minor and want to remove the information that you have posted to the Site, please contact us via the email or postal address listed in Section 16 below. Removal of the information that you have posted does not ensure its complete or comprehensive removal.</span></p>
<p id="StorageIntTransferText"><b>14. Storage and International Transfer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based globally, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information can be stored and processed elsewhere by us, our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider. The data protection and privacy regulations do not always offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). When you create an account/profile or otherwise provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the collection, storage and/or processing, in the United States and other countries, of your Personal Information and tracking technology/cookies as described in this Policy. We take appropriate measures to ensure adequate protection of the privacy rights of EEA data subjects with respect to Personal Information that we transfer outside the EEA to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission. To obtain a copy of the relevant transfer mechanism or additional information on the transfers, please address these requests to contact-us.</span></p>

In addition, we have provided the Privacy Policy Highlights section to offer a summary of the main points of our full Privacy Policy for your convenience.
